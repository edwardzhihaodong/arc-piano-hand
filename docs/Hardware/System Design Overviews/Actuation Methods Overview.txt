After reviewing different finger actuation systems such as using gears, cables, and linear actuators as well as creating a prototype based on the cable method last semester, linear actuation will be the focus this semester. The cable based method turned out to be unreliable to control and code for finer motion. Due to the results from testing the cable method, linear actuators seem to be a better alternative both in regards to precision and most imporantly in size. Though right now the focus is on linear actuators, gear-based systems are also one alternative we are considering possibly in combination to linear actuators.
