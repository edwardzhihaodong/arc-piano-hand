All files in this folder should be in the form of descriptions and reports of research performed regaring relevant actuation, Piano Hand, and design
methods, that can contribute towards the overall project. Thus this should not be a repository for papers, but rather a collection of research analyses and 
details that can be referred to later on as well as serve as a substantial part of a future comprehensive report. Realistically most updates to this folder will be done
towards the end of the semester when a shift goes from hardware to development to project summaries.
