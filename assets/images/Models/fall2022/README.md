This folder contains all the CAD files for the new designs developed for the Piano Hand during the Fall 2022 Academic semester. In total, 2 different prototype hands were developed: 
One uses geared finger actuation and geared finger seperation, and the other uses linear actuators for actuation, along with a similar geared finger seperation.

All these CAD files have been uploaded in their .f3d formats, or that naturally compatible with Fusion 360 software for easy download and upload. STL conversions
will be provided towards the end of the semester for more general use.
